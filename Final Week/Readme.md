3 things I learned in ASP.NET Core MVC Web Programming 
1.) familiarized myself with working with html in microsft visual studio, before this class i had never really used it and now I have a good grasp on it.
2.) I learned how to connect webpages on a website effiencently. As little of a concept it may be it really brings a website to the next level
3.) Lastly I really honed my CSS style skills. I can make a website really pop now and gain attraction due to visual ease.


3 things that would be an upgrade to my website
1.) Rewards system- Spending money on the app or website grants points to a user through a database which are spendable in the store
2.) User memory- Taking what the user has bought in the past and suggesting similar content
3.) Live user support- Having a text chat box for live support to help customers fufill their shopping needs.
