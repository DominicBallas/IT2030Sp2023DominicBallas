The objective of this assignment is to demonstrate the importance of databases and learn how they are used in ASP.NET Core MVC. When working with databases, Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four ways that we operate on stored data. CRUD is a mnemonic for the four basic functions of persistent storage. These functions are typically reserved for those with administrative privileges to the application. We will add a new link to our navbar to display the products and contact information views which will be different than what we had in earlier labs. Typically, we would create a separate section and store the code in the Areas folder but for the purposes of this lab, we will simply add a link to the navbar. In retail applications, customers would not see the links that we are adding. It would be for administrators. In the administrative view, we can add new products, view a product, update products, and delete products. These functionalities should not be available to customers. The admin view should have a login which we will not be completing in this lab.
